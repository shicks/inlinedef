DESCRIPTION
  This package provides a macro \Inline that precedes a \def or
  \gdef.  Within the definition text of an inlined definition,
  keywords such as \Expand may be used to selectively inline certain
  expansions at definition-time.  This eases the process of
  redefining macros in terms of the original definition, as well
  as definitions in which the token that must be expanded is deep
  within, where \expandafter would be difficult and \edef is not
  suitable.  Another application is as an easier version of
  \aftergroup, by defining a macro in terms of expanded local
  variables, then ending the group with \expandafter\endgroup\macro
